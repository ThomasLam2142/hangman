# Hangman Game

A simple command-line Hangman game where users guess letters to reveal a hidden word. The project aims to improve usability and code quality by implementing several new features.

## Feature Priority List

1. Validate user input to ensure only single letters are accepted. COMPLETE
2. Handle both uppercase and lowercase input for guesses.
3. Track and display which letters have already been guessed, so users donâ€™t repeat guesses.
4. Show the current progress of the word (e.g., "_ e _ t e r") after each guess.
5. Prevent decrementing remaining for repeated correct guesses.
6. Allow the user to select difficulty and choose different words.
7. Consider using dynamic word length instead of hardcoding array sizes.
8. Add comments for clarity and improve code readability.
